<h2><u>Project Proposal</u></h3>
<!--Problem statement: Clearly state the goal of your project.
  When someone uses your system, what is the expected input to the system,
  and what is the desired output?

Approach: Describe the technical approach you plan to employ.

Experiments and results: Describe the experimental setup you will follow,
which datasets you will use, which existing code you will exploit,
what you will implement yourself, and what you would define as a success
for the project. If you plan on collecting your own data,
describe what data collection protocol you will follow.
Provide a list of experiments you will perform.
Describe what you expect the experiments to reveal,
or what is uncertain about the potential outcomes.-->

<!-- Problem Statement -->
<h3>Problem Statement: Style Transfer</h3>

For our project, we want to be able to transfer the style of an image, specifically a painting, to another image. Below is a specific list of goals or milestones we wish to accomplish. These goals are in order of how difficult we have judged them to be:
<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Take in an input picture and convert it's style to a specific painting</li>
    <li>Have a list of preselected paintings that one can choose from to apply it's style to an input image</li>
    <li>Be able to convert both static images and videos to a specific painting style</li>
    <li>Show a live video conversion of style from camera input from a computer</li>
    <li>Implement the style transfer on an Android app, so the input can be any precaptured image/video</li>
    <li>Show a live video conversion of style from camera input within the Android app</li>
  </ul>
<br>

<h4 style = "text-align: center">Examples of style transfer</h4>
<div style = "text-align: center">
  <img style = "width: 46%; height:100%" src= "images/style_transfer_ex2.jpg">
  <img style = "width: 47%; height:100%" src= "images/style_transfer_ex1.gif">
</div>

<br>
This general technique has been done before, as evidenced by the examples. However, there are not many apps that handle this functionality, and there are no apps that are able to do direct, live style transfer. We will be attempting to implement all of these goals, and hopefully succeeding in all including the last.
<br><br>

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
Applying a style transfer involves making use of two images, one for its content and one for its style,
and applying a texture to the content image that matches the style of the style image.
This process generally involves tuning a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to minimize some combination of
style loss and content loss, as can be seen in [1].
However, optimizing this function to get good results can take a couple of hours with an
everyday computer.
Achieving our goals requires optimizing multiple parts of the general style transfer
algorithm:

<h4>Style Transfer for Images</h4>
To achieve this goal, we plan on making use of the algorithm in [2] and adding
a feature extraction/dimensionality reduction front-end to achieve faster runtimes:
Their algorithm, running on a GTX Titan X GPU, takes at most 0.21s to converge,
which will be much slower running on an average smartphone. The high level
pipeline will look like the following:
<br>
<br>
input image->feature extraction->image transform network-> CNN Loss Minimization Network
<br>
<br>
We will implement the image transformation network mentioned in the paper,
and we will use the <a href="http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/" target="_blank">VGG Network</a>
as our loss minimization network, minimizing a linear combination of
style loss and content loss as mentioned in [1].

<h4>Style Transfer for Videos</h4>
We plan on approaching this goal by treating it as an extension of the previous.

<!-- Experiments and Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?
