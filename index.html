<!-- Proposal -->
<h2><u>Project Proposal</u></h3>
<!--Problem statement: Clearly state the goal of your project. 
  When someone uses your system, what is the expected input to the system, 
  and what is the desired output?

Approach: Describe the technical approach you plan to employ.

Experiments and results: Describe the experimental setup you will follow, 
which datasets you will use, which existing code you will exploit, 
what you will implement yourself, and what you would define as a success 
for the project. If you plan on collecting your own data, 
describe what data collection protocol you will follow. 
Provide a list of experiments you will perform. 
Describe what you expect the experiments to reveal, 
or what is uncertain about the potential outcomes.-->

<!-- Problem Statement -->
<h3>Problem Statement: Style Transfer</h3>

For our project, we want to be able to transfer the style of an image, specifically a painting, to another image. Below is a specific list of goals or milestones we wish to accomplish. These goals are in order of how difficult we have judged them to be:
<br><br>
  <ul>
    <li>Take in an input picture and convert it's style to a specific painting</li>
    <li>Have a list of preselected paintings that one can choose from to apply it's style to an input image</li>
    <li>Be able to convert both static images and videos to a specific painting style</li>
    <li>Implement the style transfer using an Android app, so the input can be any precaptured image/video</li>
    <li>Show a live video conversion of style from camera input in an Android app</li>
  </ul>
<br>

<h4 style = "text-align: center">Examples of style transfer, with static image and video</h4>

<div style = "text-align: center">
  <img style = "width: 46%; height:100%" src= "images/style_transfer_ex2.jpg">
  <img style = "width: 47%; height:100%" src= "images/style_transfer_ex1.gif">
</div>

This general procedure has been done before, as evidenced by the examples. However, there are not many apps that handle this functionality, and there are no apps that are able to do direct, live style transfer. We will be attempting to implement all of these goals, and hopefully succeeding in all including the last

<br><br>

<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
To implement style transfer we will be looking at the following papers:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v2.pdf">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a></li>
  <li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08155.pdf">Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution</a></li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<!-- Experiments and Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?
